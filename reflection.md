One big challenged I encountered was creating and using loops. I definitely 
needed more practice with try/except and for loops. I also had a creative block
trying to come up with ascii art designs.
I overcame my challenges mainly over time. Just taking a break and taking a 
step back to think about it without staring directly at the screen helped.
I also had to go back in my notes and got help from one of my peers with loops.
I enjoyed working by myself because it allowed me to work at my own pace. I didn't have anyone
else relying on my to do a certain part and I didn't have to rely on another
person. I did however have to do a lot more thinking than usual because of that.
Overall, this PA definitely helped me learn how to be creative in my code
while also giving me more practice with my functions and loops.
